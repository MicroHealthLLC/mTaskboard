      <h3>What is this?</h3>
      <p>mTask Board is a simple and beautiful Chrome Apps for creating and managing todo lists locally.</p>
      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>It's built in HTML5 and Javascript, using local storage to save your todos in the browser instead of in a web server, which makes the app availible offline aswell.</p>
      <h3>Why doesn't it work?</h3>
      <p>Are you using Internet Explorer? No? Try <a href="#reset" onclick="reset();">pressing here</a>. This should reset the mTask Board, and make it functional again. However, all your current todos will be lost. Sorry.</p>
